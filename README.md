# K-Medoids-Clustering
1.The k-medoids or partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm reminiscent of the k-means algorithm.
2.Both the k-means and k-medoids algorithms are partitional, which involves breaking the dataset into groups. K-means aims to minimize the total squared error from a central position in each cluster. These central positions are called centroids.
3.On the other hand, k-medoids attempts to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between objects labeled to be in a cluster and one of the objects designated as the representative of that cluster. These representatives are called medoids.

#Dataset
The algorithm is applied on Iris dataset from SKLEARN library.

#Libraries Required
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install mpl_toolkits

## Execution Dependencies
The notebook can be run directly on jupyter.

The results are stored in a .csv file created in result.zip assigning the data to a cluster.
